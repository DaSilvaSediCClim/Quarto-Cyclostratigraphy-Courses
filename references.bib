  abstract = {The continuous wavelet transform enables the observation of transient/non-stationary cyclicity in time-series. The goal of cyclostratigraphic studies is to define frequency/period in the depth/time domain. By conducting the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic data series one can observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures from signals. These results can then be visualized and interpreted enabling one to identify/interpret cyclicity in the geological record, which can be used to construct astrochronological age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in past and present climate systems. The 'WaverideR' R package builds upon existing literature and existing codebase. The list of articles which are relevant can be grouped in four subjects; cyclostratigraphic data analysis,example data sets,the (continuous) wavelet transform and astronomical solutions.

  abstract = {We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the insolation quantities on Earth spanning from -250 Myr to 250 Myr. This solution has been improved with respect to La93 (Laskar et al. 1993) by using a direct integration of the gravitational equations for the orbital motion, and by improving the dissipative contributions, in particular in the evolution of the Earth-Moon System. The orbital solution has been used for the calibration of the Neogene period (Lourens et al. 2004), and is expected to be used for age calibrations of paleoclimatic data over 40 to 50 Myr, eventually over the full Palaeogene period (65 Myr) with caution. Beyond this time span, the chaotic evolution of the orbits prevents a precise determination of the Earth's motion. However, the most regular components of the orbital solution could still be used over a much longer time span, which is why we provide here the solution over 250 Myr. Over this time interval, the most striking feature of the obliquity solution, apart from a secular global increase due to tidal dissipation, is a strong decrease of about 0.38 degree in the next few millions of years, due to the crossing of the s6+g5-g6 resonance (Laskar et al. 1993). For the calibration of the Mesozoic time scale (about 65 to 250 Myr), we propose to use the term of largest amplitude in the eccentricity, related to g2-g5, with a fixed frequency of 3.200''/yr, corresponding to a period of 405 000 yr. The uncertainty of this time scale over 100 Myr should be about 0.1\%, and 0.2\% over the full Mesozoic era. Key},

The precession equations have also been entirely revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past or in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several different solutions that are all compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the time where geological data are now required to discriminate among planetary orbital solutions beyond 50 Myr.},

  abstract = {Major advances in our understanding of paleoclimate change derive from a precise reconstruction of the periods, amplitudes and phases of the 'Milankovitch cycles' of precession, obliquity and eccentricity. While numerous quantitative approaches exist for the identification of these astronomical cycles in stratigraphic data, limitations in radioisotopic dating, and instability of the theoretical astronomical solutions beyond {\textasciitilde}50 Myr ago, can challenge identification of the phase relationships needed to constrain climate response and anchor floating astrochronologies. Here we demonstrate that interference patterns accompanying frequency modulation (FM) of short eccentricity provide a robust basis for identifying the phase of long eccentricity forcing in stratigraphic data. One- and two-dimensional models of sedimentary distortion of the astronomical signal are used to evaluate the veracity of the FM method, and indicate that pristine eccentricity FM can be readily distinguished in paleo-records. Apart from paleoclimatic implications, the FM approach provides a quantitative technique for testing and calibrating theoretical astronomical solutions, and for refining chronologies for the deep past. We present two case studies that use the FM approach to evaluate major carbon-cycle perturbations of the Eocene and Late Cretaceous. Interference patterns in the short-eccentricity band reveal that Eocene hyperthermals ETM2 ('Elmo'), H2, I1 and ETM3 (X; {\textasciitilde}52-54 Myr ago) were associated with maxima in the 405-kyr cycle of orbital eccentricity. The same eccentricity configuration favored regional anoxic episodes in the Mediterranean during the Middle and Late Cenomanian ({\textasciitilde}94.5-97 Myr ago). The initial phase of the global Oceanic Anoxic Event II (OAE II; {\textasciitilde}93.9-94.5 Myr ago) coincides with maximum and falling 405-kyr eccentricity, and the recovery phase occurs during minimum and rising 405-kyr eccentricity. On a Myr scale, the event overlaps with a node in eccentricity amplitudes. Both studies underscore the importance of seasonality in pacing major climatic perturbations during greenhouse times.},

This is the first benthic {$\delta$}               18               O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene.

Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic {$\delta$}               18               O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of higher-resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater percentage of records from the Atlantic.

  abstract = {At the boundary between the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs, about 55 million years ago, the Earth experienced a strong global warming event, the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The leading hypothesis to explain the extreme greenhouse conditions prevalent during this period is the dissociation of 1,400 to 2,800 gigatonnes of methane from ocean clathrates, resulting in a large negative carbon isotope excursion and severe carbonate dissolution in marine sediments. Possible triggering mechanisms for this event include crossing a threshold temperature as the Earth warmed gradually, comet impact, explosive volcanism or ocean current reorganization and erosion at continental slopes, whereas orbital forcing has been excluded. Here we report a distinct carbonate-poor red clay layer in deep-sea cores from Walvis ridge, which we term the Elmo horizon. Using orbital tuning, we estimate deposition of the Elmo horizon at about 2 million years after the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The Elmo horizon has similar geochemical and biotic characteristics as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, but of smaller magnitude. It is coincident with carbon isotope depletion events in other ocean basins, suggesting that it represents a second global thermal maximum. We show that both events correspond to maxima in the approximately 405-kyr and approximately 100-kyr eccentricity cycles that post-date prolonged minima in the 2.25-Myr eccentricity cycle, implying that they are indeed astronomically paced.},

In this study a quantitative cyclostratigraphic methodology is developed to use these signal distortions as a means to reconstruct sedimentation. The method exploits a moving-window Fourier tech-nique that we designate ''evolutive harmonic analysis'' (EHA). We cal-ibrate this methodology to a specific set of geologic conditions (i.e., changes in bulk sedimentation) using a series of stratigraphic models and then apply the technique to the Cenomanian--Turonian Greenhorn Formation of the Western Interior basin. Application of EHA to strata that preserve a record of orbital forcing allows the reconstruction of a high-resolution sedimentation history in which bulk sedimentation rates and hiatuses are quantified. Using the data on bulk sedimentation rate, rates of accumulation for geochemical proxies representing de-trital, biogenic, and authigenic contributions to the sediment can be calculated. By integrating these quantitative assessments of siliciclastic dilution, primary production, and depositional redox conditions within a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework, we are able to de-convolve secular trends in hemipelagic sedimentation during the Late Cenomanian--Early Turonian in the Western Interior basin. This in-tegrated quantitative stratigraphic approach allows a reevaluation of hypotheses for the accumulation of excess organic matter in the West-ern Interior basin during the interval representing Oceanic Anoxic Event II.},

However, accurate characterization of the orbital signal in deep time paleoclimate records is commonly challenged by inadequate radiometric time constraints for calibration of the spatial rhythms to temporal periods. This problem can potentially introduce large errors into derivative orbital timescales. In this study we develop a new method for the identification and calibration of orbital cyclicity in cyclostratigraphic records. The method (average spectral misfit, or ASM) yields an objective estimate of the optimal sedimentation rate for a stratigraphic interval that preserves a record of orbital forcing. The technique also provides a formal statistical test for rejecting the null hypothesis (no orbital signal). Application of the method to assess orbital cyclicity in the upper Bridge Creek Limestone Member (Turonian) of the Western Interior Basin highlights the utility of this new cyclostratigraphic tool, and provides a means to independently evaluate conflicting interpretations of the lithologic cycles. Importantly, ASM offers a new consistent standard by which orbital timescales may be compared. Hence, the quality of an orbital timescale can be formally qualified by reporting its average spectral misfit and null hypothesis significance level. This technique will permit improvement of Mesozoic/Cenozoic orbital timescales and extension of orbital time scale development into the Paleozoic, as the method is not dependent upon well-constrained radiometric age data.},

  abstract = {Cyclostratigraphic analysis has produced fundamental advancements in our understanding of climate change, paleoceanography, celestial mechanics, geochronology, and chronostratigraphy. Of central importance to this success has been the development of astrochronologic testing methods for the evaluation of astronomical-climate influence on sedimentation. Most pre-Pleistocene astrochronologic testing methods fall into one of two categories: (1) those that test for expected amplitude or frequency modulation imposed by an astronomical signal or (2) those that test for bedding hierarchies (frequency ratios or bundling) that are predicted by the dominant astronomical periods. In this study, a statistical methodology for combining these complementary approaches is developed, which identifies the time scale that simultaneously optimizes eccentricity amplitude modulation of the precession band, and the concentration of power at precession (carrier) and eccentricity (modulator) frequencies. The technique is demonstrated to have high statistical power---it is capable of identifying astronomical cycles when present---under a wide range of conditions, and its application to synthetic models illuminates a range of potential pitfalls that are encountered when more conventional nonoptimization approaches are used. The method is also independent from the interpretation of power spectrum peak significance, resolving previous concerns regarding appropriate confidence level assessment and ``multiple testing.'' As two case studies, the algorithm is applied to Miocene strata of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 926B, and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum-Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 interval at ODP Site 1262. The results verify published cyclostratigraphic interpretations and support the theoretical astronomical solutions. This new astrochronologic testing approach can be used to evaluate cyclostratigraphic records spanning the Phanerozoic and potentially beyond.}

  abstract = {When Milankovitch cycles are preserved in the geologic record they provide a direct link between chronometer and climate change, and thus a remarkable opportunity to constrain the evolution of the surficial Earth System. The identification of such cycles has allowed exploration of the geologic record with unprecedented temporal resolution, and has spurred the development of a rich theoretical framework for climatic change. Accompanying these successes, however, has been a persistent skepticism: how does one reliably test for astronomical forcing/pacing in stratigraphic and paleoclimate data, especially when time is poorly constrained? From this perspective, it would seem that the merits and promise of astrochronology -- a Phanerozoic time scale measured in 20,000 to 400,000\,year increments -- also serves as its Achilles heel, if the confirmation of such geologically short temporal rhythms defies rigorous hypothesis testing. The implications are substantial, since much of our understanding of paleoclimate change throughout the Cenozoic (and beyond) is firmly rooted in astrochronologic interpretation. In this study, a conceptual framework for assessing Earth System response to astronomical-insolation changes, and the propagation of that signal into the geologic record, is used as a guide to understand the nature of the problem of astrochronologic testing. This framework emphasizes three challenges -- contamination, stratigraphic distortion, and temporal calibration. A statistical optimization method (TimeOpt; Meyers, 2015) is formulated as a solution to these three challenges, providing an approach for astrochronologic testing that objectively evaluates time scale uncertainty while simultaneously identifying an optimal model for climate and depositional system response to astronomical forcing. New extensions to the technique are presented, allowing explicit reconstruction of distortions to the primary forcing that are known to be omnipresent in the stratigraphic record. To illustrate the utility of this approach, it is applied to five well-studied stratigraphic series throughout the Phanerozoic, supporting their astronomical origin, and yielding constraints on the evolution of the Earth System and the astronomical solutions themselves. Future directions that build on this foundation are discussed, including the utility of process-based null models, approaches for Earth System transfer function reconstruction, and mapping out ancient Solar System behavior and Earth-Moon history using the geologic archive of Milankovitch cycles. The TimeOpt approach recognizes astronomy, geochronology, paleoclimatology and depositional system reconstruction as a unified geoscientific inverse problem.},

In this paper we present a new method based on a "local" eigenexpansion to estimate the spectrum in terms of the solution of an integral equation. Computationally this method is equivalent to using the weishted average of a series of direct-spectrum estimates based on orthogonal data windows (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) to treat both the bias and smoothing problems. Some of the attractive features of this estimate are: there are no arbitrary windows; it is a small sample theory; it is consistent; it provides an analysis-of-variance test for line components; and it has high resolution. We also show relations of this estimate to maximum-likelihood estimates, show that the estimation capacity of the estimate is high, and show applications to coherence and polyspectrum estimates.},

  abstract = {Timing is crucial to understanding the causes and consequences of events in Earth history. The calibration of geological time relies heavily on the accuracy of radioisotopic and astronomical dating. Uncertainties in the computations of Earth's orbital parameters and in radioisotopic dating have hampered the construction of a reliable astronomically calibrated time scale beyond 40 Ma. Attempts to construct a robust astronomically tuned time scale for the early Paleogene by integrating radioisotopic and astronomical dating are only partially consistent. Here, using the new La2010 and La2011 orbital solutions, we present the first accurate astronomically calibrated time scale for the early Paleogene (47--65 Ma) uniquely based on astronomical tuning and thus independent of the radioisotopic determination of the Fish Canyon standard. Comparison with geological data confirms the stability of the new La2011 solution back to {$\sim$}54 Ma. Subsequent anchoring of floating chronologies to the La2011 solution using the very long eccentricity nodes provides an absolute age of 55.530 {\textpm} 0.05 Ma for the onset of the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), 54.850 {\textpm} 0.05 Ma for the early Eocene ash -17, and 65.250 {\textpm} 0.06 Ma for the K/Pg boundary.

  abstract = {Five sections drilled in multiple holes over a depth transect of more than 2200 m at the Walvis Ridge (SE Atlantic) during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 208 resulted in the first complete early Paleogene deep-sea record. Here we present high-resolution stratigraphic records spanning a {$\sim$}4.3 million yearlong interval of the late Paleocene to early Eocene. This interval includes the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) as well as the Eocene thermal maximum (ETM) 2 event. A detailed chronology was developed with nondestructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning records and shipboard color data. These records were used to refine the shipboard-derived spliced composite depth for each site and with a record from ODP Site 1051 were then used to establish a continuous time series over this interval. Extensive spectral analysis reveals that the early Paleogene sedimentary cyclicity is dominated by precession modulated by the short (100 kyr) and long (405 kyr) eccentricity cycles. Counting of precession-related cycles at multiple sites results in revised estimates for the duration of magnetochrons C24r and C25n. Direct comparison between the amplitude modulation of the precession component derived from XRF data and recent models of Earth's orbital eccentricity suggests that the onset of the PETM and ETM2 are related to a 100-kyr eccentricity maximum. Both events are approximately a quarter of a period offset from a maximum in the 405-kyr eccentricity cycle, with the major difference that the PETM is lagging and ETM2 is leading a 405-kyr eccentricity maximum. Absolute age estimates for the PETM, ETM2, and the magnetochron boundaries that are consistent with recalibrated radiometric ages and recent models of Earth's orbital eccentricity cannot be precisely determined at present because of too large uncertainties in these methods. Nevertheless, we provide two possible tuning options, which demonstrate the potential for the development of a cyclostratigraphic framework based on the stable 405-kyr eccentricity cycle for the entire Paleogene.},

Our approach to proxy validation and development is described, primarily from a modeler's point of view. The approach is based on complementary steps in understanding the inorganic chemistry, inorganic isotope fractionation, and biological controls that determine palaeo-tracer signals in organisms used in climate reconstructions. Integration of laboratory experiments, field and culture studies, theoretical considerations and numerical modelling holds the key to the method's success. We describe effects of life-processes in foraminifera on stable carbon, oxygen, and boron isotopes as well as Mg incorporation into foraminiferal calcite shells. Stable boron isotopes will be used to illustrate our approach. We show that a mechanism-based understanding is often required before primary climate signals can be extracted from the geologic record because the signals can be heavily overprinted by secondary, non-climate related phenomena. Moreover, for some of the proxies, fundamental knowledge on the thermodynamic, inorganic basis is still lacking. One example is stable boron isotopes, a palaeo-pH proxy, for which the boron isotope fractionation between the dissolved boron compounds in seawater was not precisely known until recently. Attempts to overcome such hurdles are described and implications of our work for palaeoceanographic reconstructions are discussed.},

The simulations used different integrator algorithms, step sizes, initial conditions, and included effects from general relativity, different models of the Moon, the Sun's quadrupole moment, and up to sixteen asteroids. I also probed the potential effect of a hypothetical Planet 9, using one set of possible orbital elements. The most expensive integration (Bulirsch-Stoer) required 4{\textasciitilde}months wall-clock time with a maximum relative energy error {$<$}{\textasciitilde}3e\{-13\}. The difference in Earth's eccentricity (DeE) was used to track the difference between two solutions, considered to diverge at time tau when max{\textbar}DeE{\textbar} irreversibly crossed {\textasciitilde}10{\textbackslash}\% of mean eE ({\textasciitilde}0.028x0.1). The results indicate that finding a unique orbital solution is limited by initial conditions from current ephemerides and asteroid perturbations to {\textasciitilde}54Myr. Bizarrely, the 4-month Bulirsch-Stoer integration and a symplectic integration that required only 5{\textasciitilde}hours wall-clock time (12-day time step, Moon as a simple quadrupole perturbation), agree to {\textasciitilde}63Myr. Internally, such symplectic integrations are remarkably consistent even for large time steps, suggesting that the relationship between time step and tau is not a robust indicator for the absolute accuracy of symplectic integrations. The effect of a hypothetical Planet{\textasciitilde}9 on DeE becomes discernible at {\textasciitilde}65Myr. Using tau as a criterion, the current state-of-the-art solutions all differ from previously published results beyond {\textasciitilde}50Myr. I also conducted an eigenmode analysis, which provides some insight into the chaotic nature of the inner Solar System. The current study provides new orbital solutions for applications in geological studies.},

Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological applications concerned with past astronomical forcing rely on astronomical calculations (solutions), which represent the backbone of cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology. Here we present state-of-the-art astronomical solutions over the past 3.5~Gyr. Our goal is to provide tuning targets and templates for interpreting deep-time cyclostratigraphic records and designing external forcing functions in climate models. Our approach yields internally consistent orbital and precession-tilt solutions, including fundamental solar system frequencies, orbital eccentricity and inclination, lunar distance, luni-solar precession rate, Earth's obliquity, and climatic precession. Contrary to expectations, we find that the long eccentricity cycle (LEC) (previously assumed stable and labeled ``metronome,'' recent period {$\sim$}405~kyr), can become unstable on long time scales. Our results reveal episodes during which the LEC is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. For the ratio of eccentricity-to-inclination amplitude modulation (recent individual periods of {\textasciitilde}2.4 and {\textasciitilde}1.2 Myr, frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide distribution around the recent 2:1 ratio, that is, the system is not restricted to a 2:1 or 1:1 resonance state. Our computations show that Earth's obliquity was lower and its amplitude (variation around the mean) significantly reduced in the past. We therefore predict weaker climate forcing at obliquity frequencies in deep time and a trend toward reduced obliquity power with age in stratigraphic records. For deep-time stratigraphic and modeling applications, the orbital parameters of our 3.5-Gyr integrations are made available at 400-year resolution.                        ,              Key Points                                                                We provide orbital eccentricity, inclination, oliquity, and climatic precession for use in paleostudies/climate models over the past 3.5~Gyr                                                     The long eccentricity cycle (previously used as ``metronome'') can become unstable on long time scales                                                     Earth's past obliquity forcing/amplitude was significantly reduced.

A particular obstacle is the lack of well-defined planetary orbital constraints between 50 and 60 million years ago. Zeebe and Lourens found an astronomical solution for that interval showing that the Solar System experienced a specific resonance transition pattern.
