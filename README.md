# Quarto-Cyclostratigraphy-Courses
This repository includes different courses on cyclostratigraphy on R.

This course was designed for a Cyclonet Workshop in Coldigioco Italy on cyclostratigraphy for beginners and more advanced researchers. Part 00 corresponds to the prerequisites (how to install R, what's in the course, requested packages) and should be run prior to all the others. The course has been divided into 5 parts and beginners might do only parts 01 to 03, while more advanced researchers could do parts 02 to 05. 

    Part 01 - Introduction to R and R studio - For those needing it, an introduction of some of the basic functions in R and R studio are provided.

    Part 02 - Astrochron (Meyers 2014) - is a computational platform for conducting and learning about (1) paleoclimate time series analysis; (2) astronomical time scale construction and (3) statistical integration of astrochronologies with other geochronologic/chronostratigraphic data.

    Part 03 - Introduction to StratigrapheR (Wouters, Sébastien and Smith 2018) - which includes bases for litholog generation: graphical functions based on R base graphics, interval management functions and svg importation functions among others.

    Part 04 - WaverideR (Arts 2023) allows to apply the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic data series to observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures to construct astrochronological age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in past and present climate systems.

    Part 05 - Astrochron Advanved techniques (Meyers 2014) - more advanced techniques in astrochron (ASM, eha, TimeOpt, etc.).

The repository includes multiples files, you would need mostly the .html or .qmd files. You can either open the html files on your browser and copy each code chunck into R (there is a copy past button for each code chunck), or you can directly open the Quarto (.qmd) file into RStudio and then you can run each chunck directly into R.


How to install R and RStudio ?

It is important to have the latest version of R, so please upgrade if you have an older version.

    Download R from http://www.r-project.org

• Select a CRAN mirror site, then you will come to the download page.

• Download the most recent ‘precompiled binary’ (top of the webpage)

NOTE: for Windows, this binary will be located in the directory ‘base’

    Click on the downloaded file to install, and follow the instructions.

When installing, use all defaults.

    Download and install Rstudio. https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/




Once it has been installed, you can run the Quarto files, from 00, 01, ... to 05.
